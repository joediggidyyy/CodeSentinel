## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of CodeSentinel seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Disclose Publicly

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure could put the community at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Report security vulnerabilities through one of these methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): Use the [Security Advisory](https://github.com/joediggidyyy/CodeSentinel/security/advisories/new) feature on GitHub
- **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly (contact information will be added after migration)

### 3. Include Details

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We will provide updates on the status within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### 5. What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability:

1. We will confirm receipt of your report
2. We will investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. We will work on a fix
4. We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. We will credit you for the discovery (if you wish)

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

We regularly monitor and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. 

### Automated Security

- GitHub Dependabot alerts are enabled
- Automated dependency updates will be configured
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline (to be set up)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. Report is received and acknowledged
2. Issue is confirmed and assessed
3. Fix is developed and tested
4. Fix is released to users
5. Public disclosure after users have time to update

## Security Updates

Security updates will be communicated through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- GitHub notifications to watchers
- Project changelog

## Third-Party Security

If you discover a vulnerability in a third-party dependency:

1. Report it to the maintainers of that project
2. Notify us so we can track the issue
3. Help us coordinate an update once a fix is available

## Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep CodeSentinel secure. With your permission, we will:

- Credit you in our security acknowledgments
- Include your name in release notes for security fixes
- Thank you publicly (if you wish)

## Questions?

If you have questions about this security policy, please open a public issue (for non-sensitive questions) or contact the maintainers directly.
