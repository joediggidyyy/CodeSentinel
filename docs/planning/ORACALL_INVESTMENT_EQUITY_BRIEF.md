## 2. Compensation & ROI Allowances

- **Base Compensation & Payroll Load**: Salary bands (CEO 220k, Sr Eng 180k, SRE 170k, Sec Eng 185k, PM 150k) with a 25% load factor are the sole defined allowances to date. No bonuses, stipends, or locality adjustments are specified.  
- **ROI Framing**:  
  - *Tier 1*: ROI measured via reduced incident MTTR and improved audit readiness.  
  - *Tier 2*: ROI expands to organization-wide reliability gains, automation savings, and preparation for external offerings.  
  - *Tier 3*: ROI includes potential revenue from managed services/federated analytics plus compounded resilience benefits.  
- **Compensation Gaps**: There are no documented retention bonuses, option refresh guidance, or non-salary incentives tied to the tiers. Any such allowances require a formal update to the compensation model before execution.

## 3. Equity Division Outline

No equity allocations or ROI-linked equity grants are defined in existing planning files. To keep the decision pipeline explicit:

| Tier | Equity Status | Required Action |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Tier 1 | Not defined | Determine whether equity is granted at all for modest internal funding; if yes, specify pool size and vesting triggers. |
| Tier 2 | Not defined | Decide on equity vs. profit-sharing for expanded headcount; capture ownership impacts before onboarding. |
| Tier 3 | Not defined | Establish multi-tenant incentive plan (founder vs. employee vs. partner allocation) ahead of external pilots. |

**Recommendation**: Track equity planning as Placeholder Entry **PL-006** (see registry). Until a formal capitalization table or ESOP schedule is drafted, treat all equity assumptions as `TBD` and avoid referencing implied percentages in investor material.

## 4. Next Steps

1. Finance + Legal to propose equity pool sizes aligned with each tier and update this brief.  
2. Update `MARKET_NEEDS_COSTS_AND_ADOPTION_ESTIMATES.md` Section 5 with any approved non-salary allowances.  
3. Maintain linkage to `PLACEHOLDER_REGISTRY.md (PL-006)` so agents know equity decisions remain outstanding.  
4. Once equity allocations are defined, add a “Compensation & Equity” appendix to the multi-level grant proposal for complete traceability.
