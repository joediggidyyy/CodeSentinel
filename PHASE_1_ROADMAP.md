# Phase 1: Satellite Implementation Roadmap

**Start Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Objective**: Create core operational satellites to enable 80-90% efficiency gains  
**Status**: ACTIVE

## Phase 1 Satellites (Core Operational)

### 1. `codesentinel/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - CLI & Core Package Operations

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
**Purpose**: Guidance for work in the CLI and core package domain  
**Scope**: codesentinel/ directory and all subdirectories  
**Target Completion**: Today (November 7)

### 2. `tests/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Testing & Validation

**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED  
**Purpose**: Guidance for testing, validation, and quality assurance  
**Scope**: tests/ directory and testing workflows  
**Target Completion**: November 8

### 3. `docs/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Documentation Operations

**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED  
**Purpose**: Guidance for documentation creation, modification, archival  
**Scope**: All documentation operations  
**Target Completion**: November 8

### 4. `archive/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Archive Management

**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED  
**Purpose**: Archive operations, document archival, version management  
**Scope**: Archive operations and document lifecycle  
**Target Completion**: November 9

## Essential Quick References (All Satellites)

Each satellite includes these quick reference sections:

1. **Quick Authority Matrix** - Who can create/modify/delete in this domain
2. **Classification Decision Tree** - Which tier applies?
3. **Common Procedures Checklist** - Step-by-step for routine tasks
4. **Validation Requirements** - Before committing changes
5. **Escalation Triggers** - When to ask for user input

## Next Action

Begin creating `codesentinel/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with:

- Quick reference authority matrix for core package operations
- Common procedures (CLI development, core module updates, feature additions)
- Validation checklist before commits
- Links to detailed documentation for complex procedures
